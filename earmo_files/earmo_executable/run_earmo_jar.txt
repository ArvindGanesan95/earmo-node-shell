How to configure EARMO jar executable file based on the sample .prop configuration file

First, it is important to mentioned that we use dex2jar tool in order to extract the java source code from a *.apk file (Android app).


Replace <p> in pathProjecttoAnalize key to the path of the jar file extracted using dex2jar tool
Example: /your_folder/air.air.air.com.tabc.gsn-2014_5_11-dex2jar/air.air.air.com.tabc.gsn-2014_5_11-dex2jar/air.air.air.com.tabc.gsn-2014_5_11-dex2jar.jar


Replace <q> in outputDirectory key to the path where you want to store the results of the optimization process

Change generateFromSourceCode=0 to generateFromSourceCode=2 for analysin the .jar files.
0 only works for .class files (extracting the content of the jar file to a new folder)


Set independentRuns=5, where 5 is  the number of independent execution runs you want to peform


You can select the type of anti-patterns you want to use to generate the sequence of refactorings:

detectedAntipatterns=LargeClassLowCohesion,Blob,RefusedParentBequest,LazyClass,LongParameterList,SpaghettiCode,SpeculativeGenerality,BindingResources2Early,ReleasingResources2Late,InternalGetterAndSettersAndroid,HashMapUsageAndroid

*Note that the last 4 types mentioned above are energy smells.

Set androidEnergyDeltas= with the path to the "Deltas of energy consumption by refactoring type file"
Example:  deltas.txt

Replace <energyOr> with the path that contains the orginal App energy usage in Joules, expressed in double format.  For example E0.txt with the measurement 21.28127 in the first line for Android calculator.

**We provided a file with E0 for the 13 apps validated (Table 14), called E0_forTable_14.txt
